# About

I created this site as a way of showcasing my projects, or other general
ideas. It's a sort of _engineering_ portfolio, if you will.

This site is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator,
with my fork of the [Even theme](https://github.com/bdebyl/hugo-theme-even). It
is hosted on AWS. Deployment steps can be found in the site's [source code
repository](https://github.com/bdebyl/bdebyl-site).

# Contact

The icons at the bottom of each page on this site linking to my other sites
such as social media pages, Git repositories[^1], and email provide methods of
how to contact me.

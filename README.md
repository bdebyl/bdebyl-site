This repository houses the posts for my site [bdebyl.net](https://bdebyl.net).

I make occasional updates to add blog posts, tutorials, projects write-ups, etc. The binary static content is all hosted on S3 (i.e. `.jpeg`, `.png`, etc.).
It was setup using **Terraform**, or more specifically [alimac/terraform-s3 (from commit 4b32c8d)](https://github.com/alimac/terraform-s3/tree/4b32c8d336ffacc4318c065f8d135973210f535c) -- big thank you to @alimac on GitHub for that!
